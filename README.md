# Speedshots

For this project to showcase my Javascript skills I created a simple fast-paced quiz/question drinking game. Since it is web-based it can always be loaded quickly and it can be just a bookmark away!
 
## UX
 
This game is meant for anyone that wants fast access to a simple quiz game without having to install any apps. Straight from the home page you can start a game and start playing without having to enter any information or register. The idea is to make it as easy to play and fast as possible at its core, so anyone can access it.

Wireframes can be found in the wireframes folder.
